# Day 1 of Advent of Code - Dec 1 2017
# The captcha requires you to review a seqqq of digits (your puzzle
# input [my? their? whose?] and find the sum of all digits that match
# the next digit in the list.  The list is circular, so the digit after
# the last digit is the fist digit in the list.

# 1122 produces a sum of 3 because the second 1 matches the first and
# the second 2 matches the one before it too: 1 _1_ 2 _2_ = 3

# 1111 produces 4 - circularly, each number matches the last so the
# total of all is 4 ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 )

# 1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next (/previous)

# 9121212129 produces 9 because only the first and last digit are sequential
